# Air Pollution Visualization System Prototype

This is the code of a system that is a small prototype of possible visualizations of the RDF data located in a SPARQL endpoint populated with some air contamination data for Poland and USA.
All data visualizations are being loaded by making requests to a SPARQL Fuseki endpoint.

In order to host the code locally run `sh run.sh` - it will start a local Python SimpleServer on port 8000.
